# CarRentalDemo
This app is a basic prototype to test key features of a car speed monitoring system for Android Automotive.

What this prototype does:
  - Tracks vehicle speed using CarPropertyManager
  - Runs a foreground service to monitor speed continuously
  - Sends a warning if the speed goes over the set limit
  - Alerts the rental company using Firebase or AWS
